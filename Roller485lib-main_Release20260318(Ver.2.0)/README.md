## Overview
Simulink library "roller485lib" provides a set of Simulink blocks that make it easy to control the BLDC motor "Unit Roller485" via I2C communication.  
This library is designed for MATLAB/Simulink users who wish to control Roller485 from their Simulink models.

## Supported Versions
- MATLAB/Simulink R2023a or later

## Installation
1. Extract the downloaded files to any folder, for example:
C:\hoge\Roller485lib-main

2. Add the folder path to MATLAB using:  
```
>> addpath('C:\hoge\Roller485lib-main')
>> roller485lib
```

Note:
Placing the following startup.m file in the folder

     C:\Users\xxx\Documents\MATLAB (where xxx is your username)

will automatically add the path when MATLAB starts.

**startup.m**
```matlab
addpath('C:\hoge\Roller485lib-main')
```

## Contents

Sample files for:
* Arduino MEGA 2560 (Required R2023a or later)
* Arduino UNO R3 (Required R2023a or later)
* ESP32-WROOM similar to M5Stack Core/FIRE/BASIC (Required R2023a or later)
* Raspberry Pi Pico using Grove Shield for Pi Pico (Required R2024b or later)
